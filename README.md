Project 1 Introduction:
Aliens have kidnapped you, and after feeding you a diet of beans, cabbage, and hard-boiled eggs for days, 
placed you atop a high mesa with steep drop-offs on all sides. For their bloodthirsty amusement, they also 
placed on the mesa hungry garks, fierce creatures who would happily devour you. The aliens informed you that 
garks are fatally vulnerable to foul odors and that your diet was designed to make it a fair fight by 
enabling you to be the source of those odors.
